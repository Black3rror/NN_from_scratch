# nn_from_scratch

The main objective is to write a C code that runs (and trains) a fully connected model on microcontrollers.

## Project structure

The directory structure of the project looks like this:

```txt

├── Makefile             <- Makefile with convenience commands like `make setup_project` or `make requirements`
├── README.md            <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
│
├── models               <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries
│
├── pyproject.toml       <- Project configuration file
│
├── requirements.txt     <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment
|
├── requirements_dev.txt <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment
