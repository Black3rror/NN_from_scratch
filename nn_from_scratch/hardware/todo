CHECK Removing max memory blocks
CHECK using boolean for MemoryBlock.freed instead of int
CHECK create a makefile (important) 
in activation_functions.c, we are if checking for each operation which slows down the computation (important)
in forward_prop.c, line 32, we have the overload of calling a function. (not sure how to solve, but it's important to solve. please think about it and see if you can find a convenient solution)
in loss_functions.c, diff should be the absolute value as we dicussed previously (important)
in loss_functions.c, there is no need of defining diff (an overhead), and we could directly add a number to error. probably compiler optimizations will merge those steps for us
suggestion: make a dummy 2 layer model with 2 neurons in each layer. give it a dummy input and a dummy expected output. compute the gradients with hand and with code and compare them. you can do the same for partial update as well. (important)
have test units in "tests" folder
CHECK Enjoy coding :-) (important)
